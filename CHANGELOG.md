# Changelog

## [1.2.0] â€“ 2025-09-08
### Added
- New styles added: `classic`, `social`, `minimalist` & `pill`

### Changed
- The metrics for `follower` and `following` have been reworked, and the `-name` function has been removed for both. Github's REST API doesn't allow listing the last name sorted by date. The number of followers and followings will still be displayed accurately.

### Fixed
